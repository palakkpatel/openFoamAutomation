# Backward Facing Step Simulation with OpenFOAM and Python Automation

## Overview
This project automates the setup and execution of a Backward Facing Step simulation using OpenFOAM. The simulation setup, boundary conditions, and physical properties are configured using a Python script, while a Bash script is provided to automate the entire simulation workflow, including mesh generation, running the simulation, and generating visualizations.

This project not only automates the setup and execution of a Backward Facing Step simulation using OpenFOAM but also lays the foundation for conducting ensemble simulations and uncertainty quantification (UQ) studies. The ability to systematically modify simulation parameters via Python scripts enables researchers to explore the parameter space efficiently, making this approach particularly useful for computational studies requiring high-throughput simulations.

### Key Components:
1. **Python Scripts for Simulation Setup**
   - **`run_simulation.py`**: A Python module that defines functions to automate the setup of simulation parameters.
   - **`test_simulation_setup.py`**: A Python script that uses `run_simulation.py` to configure boundary conditions, physical properties, and control parameters for the Backward Facing Step simulation.

2. **Paraview Script for Visualization**
    - **`state.py`**: A paraview script that automates generation of Streamline and Vorticity plot.

3. **Bash Script for Simulation Execution**
   - **`simulate.sh`**: A Bash script that automates the entire simulation process, from mesh generation to running the SIMPLE algorithm using OpenFOAM, and generating visualizations using ParaView.

## File Structure

```bash
├── backwardFacingStep_template/        # Template directory containing base OpenFOAM setup
├── run_simulation.py                   # Python module for setting up the simulation
├── test_simulation_setup.py            # Python script for configuring simulation parameters
├── simulate.sh                         # Bash script to automate the entire simulation

```

## Prerequisites

- **OpenFOAM**: For CFD simulation. Ensure that the `blockMesh` and `simpleFoam` utilities are accessible.
- **ParaView**: For generating visualizations. The script uses ParaView’s `pvpython` interface.
- **Python3**: Required for running the Python scripts.
  

## Instructions

### Step 1: Setting Up the Simulation
The Python script `test_simulation_setup.py` handles the configuration of initial and boundary conditions, momentum transport models, physical properties, and control parameters for the Backward Facing Step simulation. This script is designed to copy a pre-existing template and update all necessary settings.

- **Modify Boundary Conditions**: The Python script updates initial boundary conditions like velocity (`U`), pressure (`p`), turbulent energy (`k`), and other parameters critical for running the simulation.

### Step 2: Running the Simulation (Automated with `simulate.sh`)

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the Bash script to automate the simulation setup and execution:
   ```bash
   ./simulate.sh
   ```

### Step 3: Viewing Results
After the simulation is complete, visualization files will be generated by ParaView. You can modify the `state.py` script for custom visualizations.

## Customization

1. **Adjusting Simulation Parameters**:  
   The simulation parameters like boundary conditions, turbulence models, viscosity, and control parameters can be adjusted directly in the `test_simulation_setup.py` script. This provides flexibility to test various physical conditions.

2. **Modifying the Template Directory**:  
   The `backwardFacingStep_template/` directory contains the base configuration files for the simulation. You can modify the mesh or turbulence models directly in this directory if needed.

## Example Commands
Here are a few examples of modifying the simulation setup:
- To change the turbulence model to `kOmegaSST`:
  ```python
  rs.update_momentumTransport(model="kOmegaSST")
  ```
- To update the velocity boundary condition at the inlet:
  ```python
  rs.update_initial_boundary_values("U", "(0 0 0)", "(44.2 0 0)")
  ```

## Files in Detail

### `run_simulation.py`
This Python module provides functions to automate the setup of an OpenFOAM simulation

### `test_simulation_setup.py`
This script uses the functions from `run_simulation.py` to configure the simulation for the Backward Facing Step case. It updates boundary conditions, turbulence models, and control parameters.

### `simulate.sh`
This Bash script automates the entire process of running the simulation. It sets up the simulation directory, generates the mesh, runs the SIMPLE algorithm, and creates visualizations using ParaView.

### `state.py`
A ParaView script to generate visualizations of the simulation results. This script uses ParaView's offscreen rendering mode to produce visual output files.

## General Steps for ANSYS Fluent or Siemens Star-CCM+ Implementation
### Setting up Simulation Templates

**ANSYS Fluent:**

- Use the Workbench to create a simulation template (geometry, mesh, physics setup) for the Backward Facing Step.
- Define the geometry and meshing procedure in ANSYS DesignModeler or import pre-existing geometry.
- In the Fluent Setup module, configure boundary conditions, solver settings, and turbulence models (e.g., k-omega SST).
- Save this simulation setup as a project template in Workbench for future automation.

**Siemens Star-CCM+:**

- Use the CAD Design module to create the Backward Facing Step geometry or import it.
- Create a pipeline for meshing and solver setup using Scenes and Reports to monitor simulation progress.
- Set up boundary conditions, solver models, and physics in the Physics Continuum.
- Save the case as a template that can be used in future runs by modifying input parameters.

### Automating Simulation Setup Using Java for Star-CCM+:

- write a macro to automate the following:
    - Loading the simulation template.
    - Modifying key parameters like boundary conditions and physical models.
    - Automating mesh generation, solver setup, and initialization.


## Conclusion

This project streamlines the process of running OpenFOAM simulations by automating the setup, execution, and post-processing steps using Python and Bash scripts.
